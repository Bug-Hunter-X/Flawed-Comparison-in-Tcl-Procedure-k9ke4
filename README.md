This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl: improper comparison of numerical values.  The `badproc` procedure incorrectly uses string comparison when numerical comparison is needed. This leads to unexpected behavior when comparing numerical strings. The solution showcases the correct way to handle both string and numerical comparisons using the `expr` command.
